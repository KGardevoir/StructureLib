StructureLib
------------

A library for linked structures, implemented in C, for C, with plans for C++ bindings.

This project aims to do nothing more than provide some structures to be used in C. They range from Hash Tables to Linked
Lists. Generally a structure is written in a manner to have its implementation decoupled from its usage, as such a
system of inheritence is used for structures which are markedly similar.

Current issues are:

	* Hash Tables have not been tested, so bugs have not been fixed.

Future Work:

	* Red-black, AVL, and Scapegoat Trees
	* Bloom filter for Hash Tables.
