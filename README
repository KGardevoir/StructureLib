StructureLib
------------

A library for linked structures, implemented in C, for C, with plans for C++ bindings.

This project aims to do nothing more than provide some structures to be used in C. They range from Hash Tables to Linked
Lists. Generally a structure is written in a manner to have its implementation decoupled from its usage, as such a
system of inheritance is used for structures which are markedly similar.

The library now implements the following features (most of which have been tested in at least a preliminary manner:

	* Linked Lists (single linear and doubly circular)
	* Binary Trees with some self balancing ones (scapegoat and splay)
	* Graphs (just the fundamentals currently, they are represented by adjacency lists)
	* DAG Graphs (same as graphs currently)
	* Hash Tables (using city-hash and linked processing using either scapegoat or splay trees)
	* Unrolled linked lists, basically a generalization of doubly circular lists which pack more data into each node

Future Work:

	* Red-black, AVL
	* Bloom filter for Hash Tables.
